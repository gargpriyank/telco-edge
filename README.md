# Telco Edge

This project is intended to provide examples around Telco and Edge deployments.

1) [microshift-rhacm](https://github.com/gargpriyank/telco-edge/tree/main/microshift-rhacm)

    The step-by-step guidance for deploying Microshift on the edge devices, import the cluster on RHACM and deploy a sample application onto the cluster. Please 
    refer to the original [Microshift documentation](https://microshift.io/docs/getting-started/) first and these guidelines will be helpful in case you face any 
    deployment issues. This documentation uses [rpm-ostree](https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for installation.
